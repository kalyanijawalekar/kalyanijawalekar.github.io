```

## Usage

### Importing the Library

Begin by importing PresentationKit into your SwiftUI view:

```swift
import PresentationKit
```

### Presenting an Alert

To present an alert, use the `AlertView` provided by the library. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showAlert = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Alert") {
            showAlert = true
        }
        .alert(isPresented: $showAlert) {
            Alert(title: Text("Hello"), message: Text("This is an alert!"), dismissButton: .default(Text("OK")))
        }
    }
}
```

### Presenting a Modal

For presenting modal content, you can use the `FullScreenCover` or `Sheet`:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showModal = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Modal") {
            showModal = true
        }
        .fullScreenCover(isPresented: $showModal) {
            ModalView()
        }
    }
}

struct ModalView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("This is a full-screen modal!")
            Button("Dismiss") {
                // Dismiss logic here
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Customization Options

### Alert Customization

You can customize alerts by modifying their title, message, and buttons. Here's an example of a customized alert:

```swift
.alert(isPresented: $showAlert) {
    Alert(title: Text("Warning"),
          message: Text("Are you sure you want to proceed?"),
          primaryButton: .destructive(Text("Delete")) {
              // Handle delete action
          },
          secondaryButton: .cancel())
}
```

### Modal Customization

For modals, you can control the presentation style and animations. You can also pass data to the modal view:

```swift
.fullScreenCover(isPresented: $showModal) {
    ModalView(data: someData)
}
```
